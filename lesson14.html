<h2>Currency</h2>

<h3>Honey can be used to purchase items such as tools, bags, and in-game accessories such as guards and gliding tools, and to play Memory Match. Honey can also be used to purchase products such as tickets, basic eggs, royal jellies, treats, and hive slots. In addition, honey used along with tickets, could have been used to purchase Market Boosts from the Boost Market, which is now removed. The price of many consumables increases with each purchase.</h3>

<h3>Pollen is the main feature in Bee Swarm Simulator. Pollen is collected to make honey. It can be obtained by using tools (by tapping/clicking) on flowers, from bees collecting pollen and/or activating their abilities, from some passive abilities, from meteors, and from coconuts. Flowers can have different sizes and different colors. Some quests require pollen to be collected from a specific flower color or field. There are many sources of pollen multipliers, including amulets, bags, masks, badges, hive bonuses, abilities, field boosts, field winds, and certain passive abilities.

Pollen is mainly used to convert it into honey at the player's hive, through Instant Converters, by using a Micro-Converter, Honeysuckle, etc. This is one of the most common ways to get honey. Pollen is also used as a counter to track how much a player has farmed from a field in badges.</a></h3>

<h3>Goo is a purple-to-teal substance that gives the player bonus honey when spread across flowers. It is required for all of Onettâ€™s and Spirit Bear's quests and was required for all of Gummy Bear's quests, as well as for some Gifted Riley Bee and Gifted Bucko Bee quests and some of Science Bear's quests. Using gumdrops is the easiest and common way to manually spread goo until one gets the Gummy Boots. To collect goo, collect pollen as usual (with tools, bees, and/or their ability tokens) from flowers that are covered in goo.</h3>
<h3>Field Dice is an inventory item added in the 4/5/2019 update. When used, It boosts a random field the player has access to, granting a +100% pollen Field Boost for that field for 15 minutes. If the player uses another field dice, or any other type of dice while a Field Boost from a dice is still active, the new Field Boost will override the old one, preventing the Field Boost from stacking up.</h3>
